Thirt Question.
Egg drop. Suppose that you have an n-story building (with floors 1 through n) and plenty of eggs. An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor 
T or higher and does not break otherwise. Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine the value of T given the following limitations 
on the number of eggs and tosses:
1. Version 0: 1 egg, ≤T tosses.


We have one egg and we can toss it for ≤T times. Therefore, we can toss the egg through every floors from 1-n.
When the egg breaks, we know which floor we are so we know the value of T

Answer: Sequential search

2. Version 1: ∼1lgn eggs and ∼1lgn tosses.

Assume we have 10 floors. First we toss a egg from the middle floor(5th floor) to see whether it break or not.
If the egg break, we know that T is smaller than 5. So we toss the egg from (1+5)/2=3 floors to test. If the egg doesn't break, we know that
T is bigger than 5. So we toss the egg from (5+10)/2=7.5 => 7 floor.

By this binary search method, we can know that what is T.

Answer: Binary search.

3. Version 2: ∼lgT eggs and ∼2lgT tosses.

First, we need to find an interval that contains T.

We will toss the egg in 2^k order untill the we break the egg.
toss at 2 floor
toss at 4 floor
toss at 8 .....
toss at 2^k...

Assume T=32, then we will toss 5 times to break the egg. The toss time is lg32.

When we break the egg, we know that T is between 2^(k-1) and 2^(k).
Then we can use binary search to find the T, which will cost roughly lgT toss and lgT eggs.

Answer: Toss the egg every 2^k,k=1,2,3...  until we break the egg, and use the binary technic find the T.

4. Version 3: 2 eggs and ∼2sqrt(n) tosses.

First, we need to find an interval that contains T and no larger than sqrt(n).

Let's imagine we separate n into sqrt(n) times and we toss the first egg on each separatation until we break it.

toss at the first floor. 0*sqrt(n) 
toss at 1*sqrt(n) floor
toss at 2*sqrt(n) floor
...
toss at sqrt(n)*sqrt(n) floor (the maximum floor we can toss)

When we break the egg at k time we toss, we can get the interval between (k-2)*sqrt(n) ~ (k-1)sqrt(n).
Then we can toss the egg sequentially in every floor within this interval to find the T.

Answer:Toss first egg every sqrt(n) floor to find the interval and then toss second egg within this inteval to find T.

5. Version 4: 2 eggs and ≤c sqrt(T) tosses for some fixed constant c.

First, we toss the egg as following

1 floor  1 time
3 floor  2 time
6 floor  3 time
...
((t)(t+1))/2  t times

The most t times we would try is that when T is actually ((t)(t+1))/2. 
Because we have to toss the egg t times through all interval from ((t)(t-1))/2 to ((t)(t+1))/2

Therefore, we can get the following inequation

((t)(t+1))/2 >= T

Since ((t)(t+1))/2~ t^2 /2 in large number. we can get the follow inequation

t>=sqrt(2T)

Also remember we might have to toss through whole interval so we get the following 

tosses<=2*sqrt(2T)
tosses<=2sqrt(2)*sqrt(T)

Answer: c=2*sqrt(2)
