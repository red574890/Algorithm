Permutation. Given two integer arrays of size n, 
design a subquadratic algorithm to determine
whether one is a permutation of the other. 
That is, do they contain exactly the same entries but, possibly, in a different order.


Solution:
First, sort 2 arrays.
Second, iterate over each element to check whehter two arrays are same.
